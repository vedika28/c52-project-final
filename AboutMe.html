    <h3>
        <p>
            My name is Vedika Agarwal. I am a student of Delhi Public School, Noida of class 8th. I am a person who
            tries to be positive about every aspect of life.<br>
            There are many things I like to do, to see, and to
            experience. I like to sing, I like to play, I like to laugh, I like to eat chips, I like to build, but I
            tend to break stuff.<br>
            I am kind and smart, and like to be cheerful, and light-hearted.
            I love to play tennis, and would love to be able to be like the many amazing and talented tennis players
            out there. I also love to watch them play.<br>
            I also like to code, and love to be able to experiment with new things in it. I like making different
            kinds of games, and trying interesting things in them.
